# Test project for https://github.com/v1993/esp32-sound-pcm.

"Hello world" example and base test project of `esp32-sound-pcm`.

## What that sound is?
It is me saying: "Вот небольшая запись моего голоса. Всё." (Russian, means "It is small record of my voice. Done.")

If you want, I can record english version (in this case, open issue).
